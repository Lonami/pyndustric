class Vector:
    """A Vector is a very general superclass that is used to represent anything that has .x and .y coordinates,
    including Mindustry blocks, Mindustry units, and variables that are used to represent x,y coordinates.
    You can access any vector V's .x and .y components with V.x and V.y, though it will often be more convenient to
    use vectorized operations that operate on .x and .y together, just like vectorized operations on NumPy arrays.
    E.g., adding Vector(x1,y1) + Vector(x2,y2) yields Vector(x1+x2,y1+y2).  When a scalar is mathematically combined
    with a Vector, as in Vector(x1,y1)*2, that scalar is "broadcast" NumPy-style to interact with each component of
    the vector, yielding Vector(x1*2, y1*2). In Pyndustric, Vectors are the default arguments to give for any mlog
    function or operation that requires x and y components, e.g. dst( V ) returns the distance (or magnitude) of
    vector V, and Unit.move_to( V ) directs the currently bound Unit to approach the location specified by vector V.
    Pyndustric automatically interprets any list [x,y] as Vector(x,y) (since Mindustry's mlog does not provide
    any native operations involving lists)."""
